# CopilotKit <> Mastra Starter

This is a starter template for building AI agents using [Mastra](https://mastra.ai) and [CopilotKit](https://copilotkit.ai). It provides a modern Next.js application with integrated AI capabilities and a beautiful UI.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- Any of the following package managers:
  - pnpm (recommended)
  - npm
  - yarn
  - bun

> **Note:** This repository ignores lock files (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, bun.lockb) to avoid conflicts between different package managers. Each developer should generate their own lock file using their preferred package manager. After that, make sure to delete it from the .gitignore.

## Getting Started

1. Add your OpenAI API key
```bash
# you can use whatever model Mastra supports
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" >> .env
```

2. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager:
```bash
# Using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm install

# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install

# Using bun
bun install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
# Using pnpm
pnpm dev

# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using yarn
yarn dev

# Using bun
bun run dev
```

This will start both the UI and agent servers concurrently.

## Available Scripts
The following scripts can also be run using your preferred package manager:
- `dev` - Starts both UI and agent servers in development mode
- `dev:debug` - Starts development servers with debug logging enabled
- `build` - Builds the application for production
- `start` - Starts the production server
- `lint` - Runs ESLint for code linting
